          <i>Katherine and Michael's First Photo Together</i>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Katherine Kotora and Michael Carillon's love story began in October
          2021 when they met on the Hinge dating app. Their inaugural date took
          place at the Wild Eagle Steak & Saloon in Broadview Heights. They each
          decided to try the Nashville hot chicken which proved to be too spicy
          for their palates.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Initially, Katherine and Michael were in a long-distance relationship,
          with Katherine residing in Bay Village and Michael in Akron, separated
          by a 45-minute commute. However, they made an effort to visit each
          other frequently throughout the week.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In June 2022, Michael relocated to Cleveland to be closer to
          Katherine, and they began spending most of their time together with
          Michael practically living at Katherine's house in Bay Village.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In the summer of 2022, Michael made up his mind that he wanted to
          spend the rest of his life with Katherine. He set out to plan a
          memorable proposal. He desired to propose at a location Katherine
          adores and incorporate one of the most significant aspects of her
          life, her students, into the proposal.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          On December 10, 2022, Michael popped the question to Katherine during
          the Wild Winter Lights event at the Cleveland Zoo, with the assistance
          of Katherine's principal and her students, who created a flip book
          titled "What Love Is" for Michael to use during his proposal.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Katherine and Michael both decided that they did not want a long
          engagement and planned out their wedding only 7 months later! They
          chose the Music Box Supper Club for their reception due to their love
          of music. They knew they could not wait to celebrate their love for
          each other with their families and to spend the rest of their life
          together.
